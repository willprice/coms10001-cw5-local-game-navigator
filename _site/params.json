We should work on the\r\nsame branch and then when we merge we should notify they other (by email if not\r\nin person) once we have a completed part.\r\n\r\nI also suggest we also try to keep our commit history clean so we can try things\r\nout and incrementally commit them to git. If our experiments don't pan out we\r\nshould rewrite the history:\r\n[Rewriting git history](http://git-scm.com/book/ch6-4.html)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNow in an ideal world I'd suggest we test everything and use mock objects. Given\r\nthat we only have two weeks to implement a full game this isn't going to happen.\r\nWe'll have to compromise. Let's only test meaty bits of code. Thankfully eclipse\r\nhas fairly good refactoring support so I think we should still refactor\r\naggressively. Let's not let cruft enter the repo, otherwise changing it will be\r\ndifficult\r\n\r\n## Todo list\r\n[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/2dPLIZ0c/scotland-yard-game)\r\n\r\n## Scotland Yard resources\r\n\r\n* [Rules\r\n  (Ravensburger)](https://ravensburger01.webtrekk.net/558884580617240/re.pl?t=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.com%3A80%2Fspielanleitungen/ecm/Spielanleitungen/231250%20anl%201326321.pdf&c=de.Service.Spielanleitung.Scotland%20Yard)\r\n  English rules start on page 28\r\n* [Rules (Globetrotter\r\ngames)](http://globetrotter-games.com/index.htm?E&game/rules/eScotYd1.htm)\r\n* [Scotland Yard\r\n  (Wiki)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard_(board_game))\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
