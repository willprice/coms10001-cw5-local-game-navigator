# GUI Options

* JavaFX 2 (need to install e(fx)clipse for eclipse dev, bit of a pain)
* Swing, we already know  a little bit about it from lectures. Bit outdated and
  low level, is there a wrapper? Don't need to ship libraries with it. All java
  platforms have it.
* SWT (used to build eclipse), mature, looks quite nice. Not sure how easy it is
  to program a GUI. I've got no experience.
